The Quest!

An adventure game where a mighty adventurer is on a quest to defeat level after level of deadly enemies.
Works on a **turn-based system**, which means the player makes one move and then the enemies make one move.
The player can move _**or**_ attack, and then each enemy gets a chance to move _**and**_ attack.
The game keeps going until the player either defeats all the enemies on all seven levels or dies.
